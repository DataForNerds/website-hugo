## Getting Involved

If you're interested in getting involved with DataForNerds.io, please check out:

- [Our GitHub Respository](https://github.com/DataForNerds/public) for where we generate the JSON files, perhaps you know a better way to do something or have another datasource to add.  Check our our [issues list](https://github.com/DataForNerds/public/issues) to see if there's something you might be able to fix.

- [Our Website Repository](https://github.com/DataForNerds/website-hugo) if you notice a typo or have a better way to describe something.

- Have an idea for a new source of data?  Check out our [Ideas Discussion Page](https://github.com/DataForNerds/public/discussions/categories/ideas).

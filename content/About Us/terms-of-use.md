## The Data (JSON Files)

Ultimately, you are free to do whatever you wish with the data, so long as it doesn't violate any of the rights of the creators of the data (e.g. Microsoft).  You can manipulate it and even remove the DataForNerds header that we put at the top.  If you use the data in any of your projects, it would be awesome if you attributed us, but it's not required.

## Accessing the Data

You can access our data in one of three ways:

- Our Content Delivery Network (CDN), which is just the data URLs (e.g. http://localhost:1313/data-sources/ms-mswin-releases/).
- By including our repository as a submodule of your own project (in line with GitHubs terms of use, when applicable).
- Downloading the files to be used offline, through any method that works for you.

We ask that you **do not** access the files using the underlying GitHub hosting (GitHub Pages) as there are hard and soft limits to how much content can be pulled using this method, and we'd rather not have to move around because we start to test these limits.

## Please Cache Data!

If you plan on using this data in any large projects that would put a lot of load on our CDN, we'd ask that you put some thought into caching the data on your end and making less frequent requests to DataForNerds.io when possible. This is a personally funded project not presently backed by any one with deep pockets.
